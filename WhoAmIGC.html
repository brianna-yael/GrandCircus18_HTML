<p>My name is Brianna Marshall. I grew up in the Bay Area of Northern California. I was homeschooled until the age of 14, and then went to my local community college during my high school years. I moved to Michigan when I was 18 to attend Calvin College, a private Christian school. I graduated from Calvin College in 2015 with a BS in Geology. I did an internship in Washington DC, at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in the Summer of 2015. I came back to Michigan in the Fall of 2015 to start working at the Calvin College Center for Social Research (CSR). I have worked at CSR for two-and-a-half years now as a GIS Research Specialist. I am currently taking a bootcamp in C# and .NET through the tech institute Grand Circus, and looking to go into a tech career as a developer.</p>
