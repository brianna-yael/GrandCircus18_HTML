<h3>My goals?</h3>
<p>In college, I had a strong interest in volcanology and wanted to go into a career in geology. Through my work in social research as a professional, I realized that my passions lied more broadly with advocacy and advancing the voices and interests of marginalized populations. I started exploring the worke of emergency management and hazard mitigation, and felt that this field paired my interests in geology with my personal passion. Over the next decade, I envision myself in a career that allows me to be at the forefront of innovative technologies (including C#) in emergency management and hazard education/outreach. I would love to increase disaster preparedness and resilience within vulnerable communities using creativity and technology in culturally appropriate ways. My ideal position would leave room for professional growth, financially success, and taking on new challenges.</p>
