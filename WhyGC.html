<h3>Why C#?</h3>
<p>More generally, I have just fallen into coding and technology through my academic and work experience. My REU at the Smithsonian involved a lot of MATLAB coding. My work there involved figuring out entrainment rates and behaviors for Pyroclastic Density Currents (how volcanic explosions of rock particles and gas interact with the atmosphere at varying temperatures and volumes). My work for the past two years at the Center for Social Research has been largely focus on GIS (geographic information systems). I have developed a strong skill set in relational database management, MYSql, Tableau (a visualization software), and a myriad of other technology softwares that facilitate effective social scientific research. Most of these tools, Quickbase, Qualtrics (HTML and CSS), Tableau, MYSql have all had a coding component to them. </p>
<p>I was thinking about starting a website that curates resources for women of color like books, mental health services, and business directories (a personal passion of mine), when the advertisement to take a computer programming class came through my inbox. I was not entirely sure what C# or .NET was, but the opportunity sounded to good to pass up. I applied to be a part of Develop(her) and was accepted into the intensive, 10-week course!</p>
<p>Now that I've been doing C# for 5 weeks, I can say that I love it! What I love most about coding is the way that creativity and structure work hand-in-hand. Everyone has a different coding style and the flexibility to create programs in a unique way is so empowering. I also enjoy the structure that encompasses creativity. Knowing that there are set patterns, guidelines, and best practices gives me greater capacity as a developer. A big part of my personality is understanding context. It's important for me to see the underlying structures behind people and things so that I have a fuller, more accurate picture. Back-end programming makes me feel the same way I feel when I've gotten context on a topic or person. It is the underlying structure that makes any application work. The challenge of looking beyond the surface, strategically thinking, and solving problems that are not immediately obvious makes me excited to code everyday.</p>
